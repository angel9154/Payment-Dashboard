## Purpose

The **Payment Dashboard** solves the problem of decentralized monitoring and analysis of payment transactions by providing a unified view to:

- Monitor payment transactions in real-time
- Analyze key financial metrics
- Visualize payment patterns and trends over time

---

## Why React?

React was chosen as the core framework due to:
- **Component Reusability:** Simplifies UI development by breaking the dashboard into manageable pieces.
- **State Management Efficiency:** Handles complex state interactions seamlessly.
- **Rich Ecosystem:** Supports numerous libraries for data visualization and interactivity.
